# Heli Attack

This is the source code and assets for Heli Attack 2 & 3.

Heli Attack 1 was never broadly released, it has always just been a link on my website, and it also turns out, I think I've lost the source somewhere. :|

# Retrospective

One day I will write something here, I've never really done a formal look back.

# Big Thanks

## Chris "DayDream" Hildenbrand

Art sells games, and Heli Attack always had some of the best art in the Flash scene. I continue to be proud of that game because it was quality from top to bottom, no part more so than the art!
Chris was an active member of the Flash community, I can't count how many games Chris did the art for, not for any other reason than because he loved making art. Certainly I always felt proud to work with him, and I still see his style in a lot of the art on the internet!
Thank you for being a wonderful, friendly, kind and enduring spirit. You inspire me to do more, fight more and push through pain like no other.

It's safe to say that the music for Heli Attack 3 was part of the magic.
I often recieve fan-mail saying that the music was the best part, and I think I agree! Something about that main menu music is special, I came to understand that the melody was actually part of a sample library, but the driving synth and drums really make this soundtrack one of the best!
Thank you Dave for being awesome! You brighten every room you're in and you bring a groove to the world that is unmatched.
